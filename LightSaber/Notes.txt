A typical lightsaber usually consists of a metal hilt (usually around 11 inches (28 cm) in length) that projects a brightly lit energy blade (usually around 3 feet (91 cm) in length).

Set Decorator Roger Christian found the handles for the Graflex Flash Gun in a photography shop in Great Marlborough Street, in London's West End. He then added cabinet T-track to the handles, securely attaching them with cyanoacrylate glue. Adding a few "greebles" (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a lightsaber prop for Luke before production began. George Lucas decided he wanted to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. 

Those are the most common diameters for the handgrip area on the sabers. Then various features can be narrower or thicker.
Obi-Wan ANH, Luke ANH/ESB, Vader ANH/ESB/ROTJ: 1 1/2" = 38 mm.
Most sabers in the prequels https://github.com/cohlinnand Luke ROTJ (Hero version): around 1 3/8" = 35 mm.
Anakin AOTC: 1 1/4" ~= 32 mm.

Hilt = W x 35 mm, L x 28 cm
Blade = W x 25 mm, L x 90 cm
Knobs = on/off, length, thickness?
